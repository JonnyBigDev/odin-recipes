    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jjimdak is a Korean braised chicken dish that is popular for its bold and savory flavors. It is typically made with bone-in chicken pieces that are simmered in a rich sauce made from soy sauce, sugar, garlic, ginger, and other seasonings. The sauce also contains vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, and onions, which are added to the pot to cook with the chicken. Jjimdak is often served hot and spicy, with a sprinkling of sesame seeds and green onions on top. It is a hearty and filling dish that is perfect for sharing with family and friends.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, add the chicken pieces and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes until the chicken is partially cooked. Drain the chicken and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add the potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, and ginger. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, mirin, sugar, gochujang, gochugaru, and sesame oil. Pour the sauce over the vegetables in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the partially cooked chicken to the pot, making sure it is fully submerged in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a lid and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is fully cooked and the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and turn up the heat to high. Cook for an additional 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and reduced.</li>
